Today, Chicago is called as The Windy City.
You might suspect that Chicago 
got this nickname from the winds off Lake 
Michigan, which shove through the downtown 
corridors with intense force. But the true
origin of the saying comes from politics.
Some say it may have been coined by rivals
like Cincinnati and New York as a derogatory
reference to the Chicagoan endless political
conventions.
