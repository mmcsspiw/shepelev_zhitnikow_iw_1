Thought it was created in the 
early decades of the 20th century, 
blues music has had a huge influence 
on American popular music up to
the present days. In fact, many key 
elements we hear in pop, soul, 
rhythm and blues, rock and roll, 
have their beginnings in blues music. It has never 
been the leader in music sales. 
Blues music has retained a significant 
presence not only in concerts and festivals 
throughout the United States,
but in the daily life of every person
on the planet, as well.
